        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          MLIS Graduate Student at Dominican University interested in collection development and programming, user needs, marketing and communication, and student services.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collection of artifacts from my graduate career aims to encompass my abilities as an upcoming professional in the field of Library and Information services and showcases my best work from my MLIS courses.
        </p>
        <h2>Things I've Learned</h2>
        <p>
          I knew I wanted a career where I was helping others in one way or another and for a long time I wasn’t sure what that would be, but as my undergraduate studies came to an end I realized I wanted to work with engaged learners, but also service-oriented people. When I started this graduate program, I had the goal of hoping to serve the community through collection development in public library spaces and other public programming and outreach activities. I believed working in a public librarianship could mold these interests of mine into the type of service-oriented, life-long learning career I would like to have, and as my time in the program went on, it only confirmed my belief in this work.  From the start, I have been interested in the role of libraries within different communities especially regarding the promotion of literacy and providing equitable access to books and information and the belief that these things ultimately make the citizenry stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          A direction I was surprised to become so interested in is marketing and strategic planning. A class that I was surprised to enjoy as much as I did was actually a required course: Leadership, Marketing, and Strategic Communication with Professor Annala. This course introduced leadership theories and practices to promote effective interpersonal and organizational communication in the library and information settings.  I learned about effective leadership, marketing and communication management techniques and practices, and applying design and systems thinking to create and implement information services, tools, and resources.  I consider this to be one of the key courses of the program because I learned so much, and from what I learned the content can be applied to so many jobs within the Library and Information field and in different settings. This was truly a beneficial course for future classes I ended up taking in the program, and it has also provided me with beneficial knowledge to enter the workplace, so I believe I do consider it to be one of the most significant learning experiences I’ve had.
        </p>
